# Official Python STEEM Library

`steem-python` is the official Steem library for Python. It comes with a
BIP38 encrypted wallet and a practical CLI utility called `steempy`.

Currently only python3 is supported.  Python2 support is planned.

## Installation

You can install `steem-python` with `pip3`:

```
pip3 install --user steem
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available at **http://steem.readthedocs.io**

## TODO

* fix parts that were copied from python-graphenelib that only support
  python3 to support python2 as well
* more unit-tests
* 100% documentation coverage
* migrate to click CLI library

## Notice

This library is *under development*.  Beware.
